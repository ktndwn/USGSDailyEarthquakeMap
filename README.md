# USGSDailyEarthquakeMap
## DEFUNCT, mapbox changed something and I don't have time to look into this anymore.

An interactive map using [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/) that populates daily earthquakes taken from [USGS data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Updated every 5 minutes.
